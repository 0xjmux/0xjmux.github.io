Welcome to my new website! My old one hadn't been updated in \*checks notes\* nearly 8 years, so it was definitely time for a refresh. 

I've included some stuff I've written in the previous year, along with links to [my Github](https://github.com/0xjmux) - I usually try to do a good job documenting my projects inside their own repositories, so there's definitely a couple things that aren't on here that are worth a look. 

A couple things I've done over the last few years include:

* The IoT device I built to solve the 'problem' of people asking in the IEEE club discord about the room being open. I used a Raspberry Pi 0w and the Python requests library to send messages in Discord via a Webhook. This was my first real experience considering the holistic system design of something, and I talk about some of my reasoning on the project page. I was also pretty happy with the resilience of the thing and the consideration I put into error handling. There are definitely several things I'd do differently now, but that's the case with every project after you finish it ([Github Link](https://github.com/0xjmux/room_alert_bot)).
* The tooling I built during my time doing CCDC to automate various parts of the competition ([Github Link](https://github.com/0xjmux/CCDC)). I developed a system for deploying a SIEM onto the competition network in under 20 minutes, along with a bunch of other scripts for competition needs. It was complimented by a bunch of people at competition, but my favorite compliment was our main competitor putting our entire repository into theirs ([link](https://github.com/applied-cyber/ccdc/tree/66436d548400a4fe987ea344fd7cb625db56b09f/uci)).
* Some miscellaneous PCBs I designed, some with 3D printable cases:
    * IoT driver for "Dumb" 5050 RGB LED Strips ([Github Link](https://github.com/0xjmux/iot_pwm_leddriver)).
    * [Spotify Neopixel Visualizer HW](https://github.com/0xjmux/iot_leddriver_hw), a compact and capable ESP32 based individually addressable LED driver PCB.
    * An adapter for the ESP-PROG JTAG programmer and debugger that makes setup painless ([Github Link](https://github.com/0xjmux/ESP-PROG-Adapter)).
* And some other things, too, that I'll hopefully be posting about shortly. 


Now, in constrast to my last website I will *definitely* ***positively*** keep this one updated and not totally forget that it exists in three months. Probably.

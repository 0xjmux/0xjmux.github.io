      <description>This was originally a rough guide I made for myself to retrace my steps in case I needed to re-build my LEDFx setup at some point. I ended up polishing it up and publishing it as a Gist at the request of some people in the LEDFx discord, and since people seemed to find it so helpful I&#39;m re-publishing it here.&#xA;If it looks a lot like the LEDFx documentation&#39;s installation instructions, that&#39;s because I&#39;ve also contributed it upstream.</description>
